📍**PROJECTS**:   

[🐷 **FarmLife**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/FarmLife.git) - FarmLife is a full-featured C++ simulation that models a two-dimensional world inhabited by diverse organisms divided into plants and animals. The application implements a detailed ancestry tracking system for each organism, storing birth and death turns with full support for copy/move constructors and custom assignment operators to maintain consistent genealogical data. It follows SOLID principles for serialization, allowing each organism to manage its own state saving and loading. The project also introduces polymorphic inheritance for easy addition of new species. Originally console-based, FarmLife is being expanded with a Qt-powered GUI for interactive and visually rich simulation control.


[🍓 **StrawBouquet**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/StrawBouquet_App.git) – StrawBouquet is a full-stack web application with a sleek and user-friendly frontend that lets users browse and purchase handcrafted strawberry bouquets. Designed to offer a delightful gifting experience, the app features a curated selection of unique strawberry arrangements, each presented with high-quality images and detailed descriptions. Users can explore product pages, choose bouquet sizes, and save favorites for quick access. The platform focuses on combining elegance with ease of use, making sweet moments more special through the beauty of strawberry bouquets.  


[☺️ **AI Emotion Recognition**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/MoodMirror_App.git)  – MoodMirror is a full-stack application with a React frontend and Flask backend that detects user emotions in real time using a **custom-trained TensorFlow model built and trained independently**. The app analyzes webcam video to recognize facial expressions and triggers personalized actions such as playing music or sending alerts based on detected moods. The platform leverages OpenCV for video processing.

[💄 **Cosmetic Recommendation Platform**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/Cosmetics_App.git)  - Cosmetic Recommendation Platform is a full-stack JavaScript web application that recommends cosmetics based on skin type, allows users to add favorites, and suggests websites for similar skin types. The platform uses MQTT for real-time communication, a broker for message handling, WebSocket (WS) for live updates, and TLS for secure connections.

[🎓 **E-Learning Platform**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/Learning_App.git)  - E-Learning Platform is a full-stack web application built with React for the frontend and a backend API that allows users to log in, join or create courses, participate in discussions, and take quizzes. Upon completing courses, users receive certificates. The platform provides an interactive and engaging environment for both learners and educators.    

[💰 **MoneyManager**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/Test_Bank_App.git)  -  MoneyManager is a Python-based application designed for testing purposes, focused on managing personal and corporate accounts, and handling various types of transactions such as incoming, outgoing, and express transfers. The app is built to ensure robustness and accuracy through extensive testing, without a user interface, making it ideal for developers and testers who want to verify the core functionality of financial operations in a controlled environment.

[🐱 **Pokémons Explorer**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/Pokemons_App.git)  - Pokémon Explorer is an interactive app built with React and Next.js, allowing users to browse through a wide variety of Pokémon, add their favorites, and compare them. With a user-friendly interface, this app offers a seamless experience for Pokémon enthusiasts to explore detailed Pokémon data and manage their collection.

[📊 **Insurance Agency Database**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/DBSecure.git)  - The Insurance Agency Database is a comprehensive system in PostgreSQL that manages agents, policies, and sales, helping you track insurance coverage and manage client relationships efficiently.

[🧩 **Memo Game: Animal and Color Matching**](https://github.com/hsialitskaya/Memo_Game)  - Memo Game is a memory game in Python where players match animals with their characteristic coloration, aiming to find all pairs in the fewest moves possible.
